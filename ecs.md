In Bevy, when you add a system function to a schedule using add_systems(Update, my_system), the parameters of my_system are automatically "injected" by Bevy's Entity Component System (ECS) framework. This process relies on the SystemParam trait.

Here's how it works:

#### SystemParam Trait:

Bevy systems are essentially Rust functions where all parameters must implement the SystemParam trait. This trait signifies that a type can be provided by the Bevy ECS.

#### Automatic Conversion:

When you provide a function to add_systems, Bevy uses the IntoSystem trait to convert that function into a System type, specifically a FunctionSystem. This conversion process analyzes the function's signature and its parameters.

#### Dependency Injection:

Bevy's ECS acts as a dependency injection container. When a system is scheduled to run, Bevy examines the types of its parameters. For each parameter, Bevy looks into its World (which contains all ECS data, resources, events, etc.) and automatically fetches the correct data based on the parameter's type.

- Queries: If a parameter is a Query, Bevy provides a query object that can iterate over entities and components matching the query's criteria.
- Resources: If a parameter is a Res<T> or ResMut<T>, Bevy provides a read-only or mutable reference to a resource of type T stored in the World.
- Commands: The Commands parameter provides a way to queue up ECS operations (like spawning entities, adding/removing components) that will be executed at a safe point in the schedule.
- Events: EventReader<T> and EventWriter<T> allow systems to read and write events.
- Local: Local<T> stores a local, mutable state that persists across system runs.

#### Type-Driven Provision:

The key is that Bevy uses the type of the parameter to determine what to inject. You don't explicitly pass these parameters; Bevy handles the retrieval and provision based on the declared types in your system function's signature.

This allows you to write clean, declarative system functions where you simply specify the data you need, and Bevy handles the underlying mechanics of providing it from the ECS.

Bevy employs a powerful mechanism called dependency injection to automatically provide the parameters to functions registered as systems using add_systems(Update, ...). This is achieved through the SystemParam trait.

Here's how it works:

• SystemParam Trait: Bevy defines the SystemParam trait, which various types implement. These types represent different ways to interact with the Bevy ECS (Entity Component System) world, such as:
	• Query: For accessing entities and their components.
	• Res and ResMut: For accessing and modifying resources.
	• Commands: For spawning/despawning entities, adding/removing components, and other deferred world modifications.
	• EventReader and EventWriter: For sending and receiving events.
	• Local: For system-local state.

• Function Signature Analysis: When you register a Rust function as a system, Bevy analyzes its function signature. It inspects the types of the parameters in your system function.
• Automatic Parameter Injection: For each parameter that implements SystemParam, Bevy automatically determines how to acquire the necessary data from the World and inject it into your system function when it's executed.

`You do not manually pass these arguments; Bevy handles their provision based on their types.`

Example:
```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn my_system(
    mut commands: Commands, // Injects a Commands struct
    query: Query<&Transform, With<Player>>, // Injects a Query for Transforms of Player entities
    time: Res<Time>, // Injects the Time resource
) {
    // ... system logic using injected parameters ...
}

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .add_systems(Update, my_system) // Bevy handles injecting parameters for my_system
        .run();
}
```

In this example, Bevy automatically provides Commands, a Query to access Transform components of entities with the Player component, and the Time resource to the my_system function without any explicit argument passing during the add_systems call.
